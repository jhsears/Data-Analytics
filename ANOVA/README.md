# R Project II: ANOVA and Tukey Comparisons

In this project you will use R to conduct analysis of variance (ANOVA) and create Tukey confidence intervals .

Data: https://www.kaggle.com/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021 (Links to an external site.)
Context: The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness . The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across fields – economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more – describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.
Content: The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll . The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors. They have no impact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others.

Tasks:
Choose four regions to analyze.
Use ANOVA to test that the mean Happiness Scores (Ladder score) for these regions are equal.
Do ad-hoc analysis by creating and graphing Tukey comparisons

Report:
Summarize your findings in a report. The report should be in paragraph form (not bullet points or question/answer). Be sure to
Explain why you chose your four regions to analyze and your initial expectations of which, if any, mean Happiness Scores would be equal.
State your null and alternative hypotheses and explain the results of your ANOVA.
Interpret the Tukey confidence intervals and clearly state your conclusions about the relationships between the mean Happiness Scores of the four regions.
Integrate the appropriate output (specifically the graphs!) from R in the narrative of your paper.
