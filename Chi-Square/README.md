# R Project I: The Chi-Square Distribution

In this project you will investigate how the chi-square distribution is created and what happens as the degrees of freedom increase

Tasks:
Simulate a chi-square distribution with 10 degrees of freedom.
Create a graph showing the progression of chi-square curves with increasingly large degrees of freedom.
Choose the smallest degree of freedom for which you think chi-square distribution looks approximately normal. Compare the chi-square distribution for your chosen degrees of freedom to its normal approximation (graphically and algebraically).

Report:
Summarize your findings in a report. The report should be in paragraph form (not bullet points or question/answer). Be sure to
Explain why the chi-square distribution is skewed right. (Hint: Think about the process used to simulate the chi-square distribution.)
Describe what happens to the chi-square distribution as the degrees of freedom increase.
Explain your choice for the minimal degree of freedom of the chi-square distribution that looks approximately normal and evaluate the accuracy of the approximation.
Integrate the appropriate output (specifically the graphs!) from R in the narrative of your paper.
