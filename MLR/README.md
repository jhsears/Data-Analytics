# R Project III: Multiple Regression Analysis

In this project you will use R to conduct multiple regression analysis.

Tasks:
Choose 2 or more independent quantitative variables that you think would help predict the price of the home.
Run multiple regression analysis on your data
Create a scatterplot matrix to confirm that there is a reasonable linear relationship between each of your independent variables and the dependent variable.
Run a first round of regression analysis and verify the significance of the partial slopes.
Remove any variables with insufficient significance and re-run regression analysis.
Report:

Summarize your findings in a report. The report should be in paragraph form (not bullet points or question/answer). Be sure to
Explain why you chose the particular quantitative variables to analyze.
Describe the relationship between the independent and dependent variables shown in the scatterplot matrix.
Explain why you did (or did not) need to re-run regression analysis after the first round.
State your final regression equation and explain the meaning of the coefficients (y-intercept and all partial slopes).
Do you think that your final model is reasonable? Explain what additional information you would like to consider or other analysis you would like to conduct.
Integrate the appropriate output (specifically the graphs!) from R in the narrative of your paper.
