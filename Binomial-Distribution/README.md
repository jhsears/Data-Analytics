# R Project II: Sampling Distributions

In this project you will explore the binomial distribution and its normal approximation and simulate a sampling distribution of a sample proportion.

Scenario: A store owner estimates that the number of customers who leave the store without making a purchase is between 10% and 20%.

Tasks:
Investigate the distribution of samples of customers of various sizes.
Choose a single value (0.1 < p < 0.2) to represent p, the probability of a customer leaving the store without making a purchase.
Graph a sequence of binomial distributions for samples of customers of size n = 10, 50, 100. (Use the same p for all of these distributions.)
Compare the binomial distribution to its normal approximation in each case.
Find the mean and standard deviation of your binomial distribution for each sample size and construct a normal distribution with these parameters.
Graphically/algebraically compare the probabilities from the two distributions.
Simulate constructing a sampling distribution for the proportion of customers who leave the store without making a purchase.
The sampling distribution is useful if it is approximately normally distributed, so choose a sufficiently large value for the sample size of customers, n, given your previously chosen probability of a customer leaving without make a purchase, p. (Hint: Think about the conditions needed to invoke the CLT.)
Simulate collecting samples of that size many times (1000 or more). This is your sampling distribution.
Find the mean and standard deviation of your collection of outcomes.
Compare these values to the theoretical mean and standard deviation (standard error) of your sampling distribution.

Report:
Summarize your findings in a report. The report should be in paragraph form (not bullet points or question/answer). Be sure to
Explain why a binomial distribution is an appropriate model for the number of customers who leave the store without making a purchase.
Comment on the accuracy of the normal distribution as an approximation of the binomial distribution.
Explain how large of a sample size is needed to construct a sampling distribution for the sample proportion that is approximately normal.
Comment on the suitability of the normal distribution as an approximation of the sampling distribution of the proportion.
Discuss how the normal model of the sampling distribution could be helpful in analyzing the performance of the store over time. (Examples might be useful here.)
Integrate the appropriate output from R in the narrative of your paper.
